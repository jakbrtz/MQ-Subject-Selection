# MQ-Subject-Selection

This application is supposed to help students create a study plan by recommending subjects and making sure all prerequisites are met.

At the moment, it gets information from a database found at [http://reports.handbook.mq.edu.au/internal/index_2020.php](http://reports.handbook.mq.edu.au/internal/index_2020.php). 
I copied files from that site and saved them as text. 
I had to modify some of the prerequisites so they will get parsed correctly.
